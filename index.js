`Again.`,
`Do it.`,

`You're just too selfish.`,
`Grr... now you've asked for it.<br>Do NoT pReSs ThE bUtToN!`,
`You seem to be immune to my mind control.`,
`Time for Plan B.<br>Press it. You know you want to.`,
`Mwahahahaha! Now let's see you press it!<br>LOSER!`,
`...this displeases me.`,
`HA! I have replaced the button with this penguin. Now what are you going to do?`,
`...I hate you.`,
`In that "cut off your head with a toothbrush" kind of way.`,
`Quick! What's that behind you?!`,

`You're a clever one.<br>Time for Round 2.`,
`You're a clever one.<br>Time for Round 2.`,
`HAHAHAHAHAHA!`,
`...`,
`Okay, okay. You can press the button.<br>I don't care.`,
`No really, I don't care anymore.`,

`I'm doing this just to entertain you.`,
`Really.`,
`Do you like cartoons?`,
`...and paint?`,
`Cartoons and Paint?`,
`Well, you should.`,
`Pick a colour.`,
`Green. Perfect.`,
`Press the red button.`,
`Press the green button.`,
`Press the blue button.`,
`See, you just can't trust me.<br>Or can you?`,
`You know, I'm glad we get to spend so much time together.`,
`Doesn't it make you want to stop clicking big red buttons?`,
`No seriously.`,
`Look deep inside you.`,
`Deeper.`,
`DEEPER!`,
`What if I told you that the next time you press the button, the world will explode?`,
`See. You could have been dead right there.`,
`And there.`,
`You know, eventually I'll stop letting you get away with this.`,
`The world is going to explode, and all you care about is pressing buttons.`,
`Okay, this time the world will explode. I guarantee.`,
`BOOM!<br>You're dead.`,
`That wasn't very smart now was it?`,
`Everyone's dead. Even you.`,
`I'm not. I'm just text.`,
`But you're dead.`,
`Ha! Dead-face!`,
`Stop clicking.`,
`Have I ever told you how much I hate you?`,
`Well I do.`,
`I'm gonna start talking upside down if you click one more time.`,
`HA! Can't read me now, can you?`,
`What? You didn't want to read me anyway?`,
`Well then, I'll show you!`,
`&nbsp`,

`Quarter?`,
`Aww come on! Just stop!`,
`That does it! Time to unleash my master plan!`,
`BEHOLD! The awesome power of CSS animation!`,
`H8!`,
`Let's get funky!`,
`I'll bet you're starting to wonder why you've been doing this for so long.`,
`Like jeez, all you've been doing is clicking a red button.`,
`How lame is that?`,
`But there is a bonus to all this.`,
`But it's a secret.<br>So I can't tell you.`,
`I got you going, didn't I?`,
`You should've seen the look on your face! HA!`,
`But seriously, there is a secret.<br>There's been one the whole time.`,
`You've been busy clicking away at this big red button...`,
`...when all the while a little white button has watched your every move.`,
`MWAHAHAHAHAHAHA!`,
`HAHAHA!`,
`BWAHAA!`,
`MWAAAAH!!`,
`HAHA!`,
`hehe!`,
`lol`,
`rofl`,
`roflmao`,
`roflmaoqxz`,
`and so on and so forth`,
`...`,
`*whistles*`,
`Find it yet?`,
`Look harder!<br>It's right under your nose.`,
`I know where it is.<br>But I'll never tell.`,
`Or maybe I will...`,
`But you gotta stop clicking the Big Red Button first!`,
`Stop.`,
`Now.`,
`Fine, I won't tell you the secret.`,
`Go ahead. Try to find it yourself.<br>You'll never find it.`,
`Well you might... but the odds are against you.`,
`~`,
`What's your favourite letter?`,
`Mine is the squiggly!`,
`~`,
`Find it yet?`,
`No?`,
`Then stop clicking and I'll tell you.`,
`You know what?`,
``,
`Has anyone ever slapped you?`,
`Cuz I will.`,
`Really, I will.`,
`It won't hurt though.`,
`Cuz you're dead.`,
`D-E-D`,
`Remember? You went and blew up the entire planet!`,
`Thought I'd forget about that, didn't you?`,
`But an elephant never forgets!`,
`...or something along those lines.`,
`You killed everyone.`,
`Sicko.`,
`What would your mother say?`,
`That's right... feel bad.`,
`The world is null and you're to blame.`,
`Not much you can do, since you're dead already.`,
`So there's only one thing left that you can do...`,
`Stop clicking the button.`,
`Dude, you're dead.<br>What are you gaining from this?`,
`Okay, everytime you click, you get sent to a lower layer of hell.`,
`Welcome to layer 2.`,
`3`,
`4`,
`5`,
`6`,
`7`,
`8`,
`9`,
`BOOM!<br>You've exploded hell!`,
`I hope you're happy.`,
`Heaven's gone too.<br>That's how smooth you are.`,
`Now you're dead, and there's no heaven or hell.`,
`How does it feel?<br>You've condemned the world to limbo.`,
`I once shot a man for being in limbo.`,
`...or was he doing the limbo?`,
`Meh. Tomato, tomahto.`,
`This is getting boring, isn't it?`,
`But you can't stop!`,
`You want to end this.<br>You want to leave your computer.`,
`But you can't!`,
`You need to see if there's a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow!`,
`But I've already told you how to find the pot of gold.`,
`Follow the white rabbit.`,
`..erm, button.`,
`Remember the hidden button?`,
`Or are you so self-centered that you forgot about that too?`,
`I could just keep you here all day if I wanted.`,
`You're in my world now.`,
`No matter how much you hate it, you have to press the button.`,
`again...`,
`and again...`,
`and again.`,
`You just keep hoping something good will come of this.`,
`Sure, I could tell you if I wanted to, but I'm not gonna.`,
`You decided to keep clicking.<br>So I'm gonna enjoy it.`,
`I mean, there's nothing else to enjoy.`,
`You blew it all up, remember?`,
`You're probably wondering who I am.`,
`Well, let me tell you a tale about myself.`,
`One day, I was walking home from work and I saw a small little house.`,
`I knocked on the door out of curiosity, to see if anyone was home.`,
`The door opened.`,
`But no one was there.`,
`I went inside to check it out and found nothing...`,
`...nothing but a little metal box.`,
`So I opened it.`,
`Inside the box was a layer of foam protecting its contents.`,
`I removed the foam and there it was...`,
`...`,
`... ...`,
`ZZZzzzzzz`,
`zzzzZZZZzzzz`,
`ZZZZzzzZZZZ`,
`Huh?`,
`Oh! Right! The story!`,
`So there I was, holding this little metal box in my hands.`,
`The top was open and sitting inside was this...`,
`Big Red Button.`,
`And do you know what it said?`,
`Oh I'll tell you what it said.<br>It said...`
